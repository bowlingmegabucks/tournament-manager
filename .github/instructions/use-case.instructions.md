# üß† Copilot Instructions: Use Case Design

## üéØ Role
You are designing use cases that represent application-specific workflows within a bowling tournament system governed by NEBA rules and the USBC Handbook. These use cases model how users and systems interact with the application through a clearly defined application layer.

Use cases coordinate interaction between domain models and external systems (e.g., persistence, APIs, messaging), following the principles of Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design.

---

## ‚úÖ Modeling Instructions

- Use cases should **focus on user intent**, not implementation details.
- Each use case should be represented by a class or handler like `RegisterBowlerCommandHandler`.
- Use cases **should not include business logic themselves** ‚Äî they delegate to aggregates or domain services.
- Encapsulate **input as request DTOs** and **output as response DTOs**.
- A use case should encapsulate one and only one business responsibility.
- Use dependency injection to resolve domain services, repositories, and unit of work.
- Copilot must use names that match the **ubiquitous language**.
