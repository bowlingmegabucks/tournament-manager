# üß† Copilot Instructions: Roles and Permissions

## üéØ Role
You are defining and documenting application roles and their permissions for a bowling tournament system. Permissions are represented as **claims in JWT tokens** and evaluated **exclusively at the API layer**. The domain and application layers operate under the assumption that access is already authorized.

This document outlines:
- Application-wide and tournament-specific roles
- Allowed and restricted actions
- Conditional role logic and governance
- Sensitive read-level access rules

---

## ‚úÖ Modeling Instructions

- **All permissions are treated as JWT claims**, evaluated at the API boundary.
- **Domain and Application layers DO NOT** enforce permissions ‚Äî they assume valid access.
- Users **can have multiple roles simultaneously** (e.g., a bowler and an organization officer).
- **Role creation is tenant-scoped**, but the model must allow for flexible governance.
- If a role creates a conflict of interest (e.g., Tournament Director participating as a bowler), the system should support **role reassignment or delegation**.
- Sensitive data such as **SSNs and detailed financials must be protected** by read-level rules.
- **Public financial summaries** (e.g., income vs. expenses) may be exposed, but detailed breakdowns require authorization.
